                    <hr>
                    <p class="text-muted text-left">PICT Nestling (The Preschool and Child Enrichment Centre) is an offering from the Society for Education Training and Research (SETR).
                        It has been set up to offer two parallel programmes, the Preschool and the Child Enrichment Centre, under its umbrella. The Preschool caters to age group of 2.4 to 5.6 years while the skill development programme is designed for children from 6 months to 11 months. Young learners in the Nestling Preschool are trained appropriately and adequately to allign themselves with the vision and mission of PICT Nestling.

                        PICT Nestling (The Preschool and Child Enrichment Centre) structured program offers a balanced blend of Experiential discovery and the Montessori Method catering to infants from 6 months to young children aged 8 years. PICT Nestling maintains a healthy child staff ratio. Our age appropriate activities cater to the cognitive and physical needs of toddlers and young learners. They are given opportunities which aim to develop:

                        -Aesthetic and creative expression

                        -Discovery of the world

                        -Language and literacy

                        -Motor skills development

                        -Numeracy

                        -Personal, social and emotional development

                        We believe that children are nourished best in natural surroundings. Engaging in natural and indigenous play helps children bloom into happy individuals. PICT Nestling has large open areas for outdoor play, exercises and games. The indoors are spacious, have child friendly washrooms, soft flooring and cushioned walls, an infirmary and has a hygienic kitchen and dining area.</p>

            <p class="p_modal">I like aeronautics and space science. I like space science because it has part of aeronautics - sending rockets into space. Also I am curious about space. I want to find out about all the mysteries of Space Science. I wish to make a rocket to reach the stars. I am curious what happened after the universe began? Or does it have beginning or end?

In this vast universe with so many galaxies having millions of stars and millions of planets, can’t there be a planet with life? Can it have life /organisms like there are on earth? Can we develop science in such a way that we can explore this?

How did single cellular life evolve from simple molecules? Why can’t we explore more about this fascinating subject? Can there be a planet where Mesozoic era is going on when we have Cenozoic era here on earth now? Will life follow same kind of evolution on other planets as it followed on earth? Will life always be oxygen based?

Why are we searching for only oxygen based life on other planets? Can there be a planet on which there is life based on different elements which are not found on earth? Can we develop the science to explore this on other planets?<br>

            <p class="p_modal">MY SCHOOL
PICT Model School is the best of schools,
Despite its strict rigor and rules.
The teachers are caring and kind,
Their teaching helps to improve my mind.
Yoga, badminton and basketball,
Games and sports are liked by all.
The classrooms are tidy and clean,
The snacks and meals are tasty yet lean.
I love to chat with my friend on the bus ride,
and watch the houses, trees and shops by the roadside.<br>
